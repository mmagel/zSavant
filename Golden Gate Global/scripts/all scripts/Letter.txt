
Dear Investor,

We are writing to request your preferred return option and bank account information so that we can distribute your annual EB-5 investment preferred return accordingly.

By December 10th, 2017, please fill out the information on the following page and sign to return.

Please note:
1. Your name must be designated as a beneficiary of your account to receive the return.

2. Due to policy changes by the People’s Republic of China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), banks based in mainland China might reject currency transfers related to overseas securities earnings. We therefore strongly suggest you use a non-mainland China-based bank account.

Please let us know if you have any questions. Should there be any changes to your preferred bank account or return option in the future, please be sure to notify us by sending a signed notification letter to [ADMIN EMAIL] in order to ensure that you receive your returns without disruption.

Thank you for choosing Golden Gate Global for your EB-5 investment. 

Sincerely,
